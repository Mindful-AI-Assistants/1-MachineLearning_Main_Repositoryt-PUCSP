## What is Machine Learning? (Kid-Friendly Explanation) 🌈
Imagine teaching a robot puppy to fetch a ball. You show it many examples (data), it tries, makes mistakes, and gets better each time – without you telling it every single step. That's Machine Learning (ML)! Computers learn patterns from data, like how kids learn by playing and trying.  

**Key topics here:**  
- **Neural Networks**: Like a brain made of tiny math "neurons" connected together. They guess answers and fix mistakes automatically.  
- **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)**: A simple "brain" with layers – input (sees data), hidden (thinks), output (decides). Like stacking Lego blocks to solve puzzles.  
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**: Super for pictures! Spots edges, shapes, then faces – like your eyes scanning a photo. Great for cat vs. dog pics.  
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch (fast on Apple M-series chips, feels like Python magic) and TensorFlow (Google's tool, runs anywhere). They build these "brains" without supercomputers.

## Course Objectives
Present basic and advanced concepts of artificial neural networks (ANNs), their biological inspiration, and real-world applications. Focus on building practical systems with supervised/unsupervised models like MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, GANs, and Reinforcement Learning. Includes extensionist projects for social good (open-source repos for communities).
